# Shaw and Partners Frontend Test

## 1 - [full-stack] [back-end]
Create an API that will proxy all client requests to the appropriate GitHub endpoint. The following endpoints must be provided:

- GET - /api/users?since={number}
This endpoint must return a list of GitHub users and the link for the next page.

- GET - /api/users/:username/details
This endpoint must return the details of a GitHub user

- GET - /api/users/:username/repos
This endpoint must return a list with all user repositories

## 3 - [full-stack] [front-end]
Create a screen that will list all users from GitHub and will display their Id and Login. Remember, you canâ€™t list all users at once you will have to use pagination.

(if you are doing this test for the front-end role you have to consume the GitHub endpoints directly)

(if you are doing this test for the full stack role you must consume the endpoints that you created at step 1. )

## 4 - [full-stack] [front-end]
Using the screen created in step 3, create a new screen that will display the details of a user (Id, Login, Profile URL and the date of the login creation).

## 5 - [full-stack] [front-end]
On the details screen (created on step 4) add a table that will display the public repositories of the user, this table must contain the id, name, and URL to the repository.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
